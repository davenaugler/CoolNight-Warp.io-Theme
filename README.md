# CoolNight-Warp.io-Theme

Inspiration is pulled from `Josean Martinez` with his YouTube video on **How To Make Your Boring Mac Terminal So Much Better** (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF1tMjvHDRA&ab_channel=JoseanMartinez).

I wasn't able to find the iTerm2 to Warp theme comverter so I manually did it. Warp.io has a few features to release before the font weight is a match but we're 90% there.
