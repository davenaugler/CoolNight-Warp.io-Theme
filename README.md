# CoolNight Warp Theme

## Warp
Your terminal, reimagined. Feature rich terminal for macOS. Windows/Linux is coming. Download **[Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)** or head over to use **`brew install --cask warp`**.

## Inspiration
Inspiration is pulled from `Josean Martinez` with his YouTube video on **[How To Make Your Boring Mac Terminal So Much Better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF1tMjvHDRA&ab_channel=JoseanMartinez)**

I wasn't able to find the iTerm2 to Warp theme converter so I manually did it. Warp has a few features to release before the font weight is a match but we're 95% there.

## What's left?
- Add bold `feature` to Warp themes
- This is a feature request on [warpdotdev's](https://github.com/warpdotdev) GitHub 
    - [Support "Draw Bold Text In Bright Colors" option in theme #3393](https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/issues/3393)
