# CoolNight-Warp.io-Theme

Inspiration is pulled from `Josean Martinez` with his YouTube video on **[How To Make Your Boring Mac Terminal So Much Better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF1tMjvHDRA&ab_channel=JoseanMartinez)**

I wasn't able to find the iTerm2 to Warp theme converter so I manually did it. Warp.io has a few features to release before the font weight is a match but we're 90% there.

## What's left?
- Add bold feature to Warp.io themes
- This is a feature request on warpdotdev's GitHub (https://github.com/warpdotdev)
    - Support "Draw Bold Text In Bright Colors" option in theme #3393 (https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/issues/3393)
